## Features

List the key features of your project:
Feature 1: Safety Dashboard with Neighborhood Pulse A central hub displaying real-time safety metrics like a "Neighborhood Pulse" score (72% Safe) and environmental caution warnings (e.g., low lighting), along with an Emergency SOS button (press & hold for 3 seconds) that triggers safety alerts.
Feature 2: Active Alerts Map with Safe/Unsafe Zone Visualization An interactive SVG city map that visually marks Safe Zones (green) and Danger Zones (red) with a live "You Are Here" location pulse, alert popups for unsafe areas (e.g., poorly lit streets), a legend, and zoom controls.
Feature 3: Local Emergency Services & Digital Vault Quick-dial buttons for Police (100), Medical (108), and Fire (101) services, an embassy contact link, and a Digital Vault for securely storing emergency documents (passport, ID card, emergency docs).
Feature 4: City Facilities Directory & Profile Management A searchable directory of nearby safety-verified facilities (hospitals, police stations, verified hotels) with distance, ratings, and call buttons, plus a Profile & Settings screen with personal/medical info (blood type, allergies), dark mode toggle, low-data mode, and share live path functionality.

- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions"

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
